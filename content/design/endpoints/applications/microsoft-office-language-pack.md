Microsoft Office Language Pack
---

This section describes the design decisions associated with the Microsoft Office Language Pack.

Language packs add additional display, help and proofing tools to Microsoft Office. Multiple language packs can be installed to support specific user requirements. If additional language packs are installed it is also likely that keyboards other than US will be required.
