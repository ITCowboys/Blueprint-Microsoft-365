### What is Blueprint-Microsoft-365's *Blueprint for Secure Cloud*?

Blueprint-Microsoft-365 provides better practice guidance, as well as configuration guides and templates covering risk management, architecture and standard operating procedures developed as per the controls, configuration and deployment of collaborative and secure cloud and hybrid workspaces, with a current focus on Microsoft 365.

### How does the Blueprint interact with broader suite of Cloud Security guidance and other security frameworks? 

Blueprint-Microsoft-365 provides advice on securing the use of cloud computing services for government, large organisations and infrastructure, and small and medium businesses. 

The Blueprint is an online tool to support the design, configuration and deployment of collaborative and secure cloud and hybrid workspaces built on Microsoft 365, and should ideally be used in conjunction with all the other security and compliance frameworks and Cloud Security guidance like CIS, GDPR and even BIO for governance controls. 

### What benefit does the Blueprint provide to organisations?

The Blueprint provides a pathway for organisations to build secure cloud or hybrid workspaces. Using the Blueprint's templates and guidance to securely implement cloud or hybrid workspaces will help organisations drive productivity and business outcomes by enabling staff to work and collaborate from the office or from home.

The Blueprint also aims to support organisations to move away from using unsecure, aging, and bespoke legacy systems, and move to innovative, secure, and configurable systems that are well-supported by enterprise vendors including Microsoft.

### Will the Blueprint be updated as terminology and technology changes?

The Blueprint is informed by our experience in responding to cyber security incidents, performing vulnerability assessments and penetration testing Dutch and European government organisations. Our Blueprint-Microsoft-365 uses our threat intelligence, as well as feedback from partners across government and industry, to ensure our cyber security advice is contemporary and actionable.

The Blueprint-Microsoft-365 will continue to regularly update and improve the Blueprint to ensure it remains a trusted and up to date resource. 

### Will implementing the Blueprint ensure a cloud system is PROTECTED, OFFICIAL: Sensitive or OFFICIAL? 

Implementation of the Blueprint does not certify or endorse a cloud system as suitable to handle OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL: Sensitive or PROTECTED information, but does provide practical guidance for commercial and government organisations to consider alongside the Blueprint-Microsoft-365 best practices, ISM and the supported security frameworks we include. Remember the blueprint is a quick start for every organisation to help you secure your environment.

### How do I get in touch with other organisations using the Blueprint?

The Blueprint provides an avenue to share lessons learnt and best practice in deploying and configuring cloud or hybrid workspaces across a range of use cases and organisations. We are committed to building community of practice around the Blueprint to bring organisations together on a collective journey implementing, updating and growing the Blueprint.
