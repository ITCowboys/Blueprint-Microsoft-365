### Using the Blueprint

The Blueprint provides better practice guidance, configuration guides and templates covering risk management, architecture and standard operating procedures developed as per the controls. It is recommended to refer to official frameworks for a guidance suite when using the Blueprint to get a better understanding of the rationals. 

Adopting the Blueprint is as much a business transformation as it is a configuration and implementation process. Implementation of the Blueprint will differ depending on an organisation's operating context and organisational culture. Organisations should implement the Blueprint in alignment with their existing change management, business processes and frameworks. 

### Jumpstart Your Secure Microsoft 365 Journey with the Blueprint
The Microsoft 365 Blueprint empowers organizations to confidently navigate their cloud migration. This comprehensive resource equips you with the essential tools to establish a solid foundation for secure and compliant configurations in Microsoft 365.

Built on Industry Expertise:

We've meticulously crafted the Blueprint by incorporating best practices and recommendations from leading institutions like the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), Center for Internet Security (CIS), Baseline Infrastructure Online (BIO), and others aligned with data protection regulations like GDPR, NIST, and NIS2.

The Blueprint Advantage:

Streamlined Implementation: Our Blueprint acts as a launchpad, providing practical guidance to jumpstart your Microsoft 365 configuration.
Security-Focused Design: Leverage best practices to enhance your cloud environment's security posture.
Compliance Considerations: The Blueprint highlights relevant regulatory frameworks, empowering you to make informed decisions for your specific needs.
Important Note:

The Microsoft 365 Blueprint serves as a valuable starting point.  Implementation does not guarantee  your environment meets the stringent requirements for handling OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL: Sensitive or PROTECTED information as outlined in the Information Security Manual (ISM) and Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF).  However, it provides a strong foundation to consider alongside these official documents when designing, configuring, and deploying secure cloud or hybrid workspaces.

### A refreshed Blueprint

*the Microsoft 365 Blueprint* is designed to assist organisations in making, documenting, implementing and communicating decisions within their unique operating context and organisational culture. Guidance on configuration has been segmented into smaller pages aligned with each Microsoft 365 service and application. This will assist organisations in making informed risk-based decisions  on how to best implement each of these services to suit their needs. 

These updates aim to meet organisations wherever they are in their use of previous versions of the Blueprint, to continue to use it as a tool to manage and track their ongoing implementation of Microsoft 365 services and applications over time and implement new products as they become available. 

### Intended audience

While the Blueprint is primarily developed for Dutch and European Government organisations and the commercial sector, private sector organisations may also find the Blueprint a useful resource. The intended audience for the Blueprint is:

* Administrators, architects, engineers and developers implementing cloud computing services
* Technical management, Information Technology security stakeholders and assessors assessing implementation of cloud computing services
* Business sponsors and other senior stakeholders approving or authorising cloud computing services, and 
* Others that have a technical interest in oversight, assessment, authorisation or administration of cloud computing services.
